Becky, 34, posted a photo of the two at the time and wrote, “Happiest day of my life. For the rest of my life,” complete with a wedding ring emoji. About a year after the engagement, Seth and Becky <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their first child</a> together, a baby girl named <strong>Roux</strong>, in December 2020. Becky announced the news with a sweet <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram photo</a> of baby Roux grasping onto her fingers. “Welcome to the world Roux,” she captioned the post.”You are the love of our lives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Seth-Rollins-Becky-Lynch-WWE-Stars-Wed-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The pair’s happy wedding day comes after COVID-19 delay. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Extra.ie</a> last December, Becky said the pandemic, naturally, affected their original wedding plans. “That’s going to to get pushed back, obviously.” However, she wasn’t worried. “Look, at the end of the day, I’m going to be with him forever,” Becky added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Quarantine wasn’t all bad for the lovebirds, though. Seth spoke to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> exclusively in March 2020 about how the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two were “taking advantage”</a> of their time in quarantine together. “We’re taking advantage of the downtime and cook some dinners, watch movies, and hang out. We don’t really get a lot of time to do that,” Seth said, adding, “Just enjoy quality time as opposed to work time, which is where we spend most of our time doing. Luckily she is not one of those fussy types that need a whole lot to be entertained, so I am okay and I will be alright. I think she is down with drinking beers and&nbsp;hanging out.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>With a new baby — and now, marriage! — the quality time is far from over. Congratulations are in order for Seth and Becky.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49qZqydpJ16s7vLpaCnq12XsqS32GajsqaTnXqurdGroJ6cXayypbDIp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maanvi-gagroo-movies-series-tv-shows-height-weight-and-bio.html><span>←</span><span>Maanvi Gagroo movies, series tv, shows, height, weight and bio The Talks Today</span></a>
