Zeynep leaves her city life behind when her mother dies and leaves her a house in Croatia. She expects to find a fresh viewpoint and a solution to her problems there, but instead she meets Josip Cega, a grumpy, argumentative man. Zeynep navigates the unfamiliar Croatian waters of living on the same property as Josip while attempting to prevent the disintegration of her former life. She rediscovers <a href=#>happiness</a> in the process and sees life from a fresh perspective. Here are some suggestions for you if you liked Zeynep’s transformational journey prompted by a mid-life crisis and are yearning for similar heartwarming stories about self-discovery. The majority of these films, including “Faraway,” are available on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu!</p><h3>Bread And Tulips (2000)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bread-And-Tulips-2000.jpg alt="faraway movie 2023,faraway netflix,faraway netflix cast,faraway movie netflix,sky high imdb,luther movie,outlast movie,sky high netflix,movies 2023 full,movies like falaknuma das,similar movies like karwaan,movies like far cry" width=1024 height=597 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Silvio Soldini is the director of the Italian <a href=#>romantic comedy</a> “Bread and Tulips”.

She meets Tony there and falls in love with him as she gains her independence. Eilis’ homesickness lessens as she spends more time in New York, and her bond with Tony grows stronger. Nevertheless, when she needs to fly back home, the stability she had discovered in New York with Tony is swiftly put to the test. She meets Jim there, and now she must choose between her two possible futures.</p><p>In “Faraway,” a midlife crisis is discussed, while in “Brooklyn,” a <a href=#>coming-of-age</a> story is told.
