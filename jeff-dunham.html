It was when he reached the 4th grade that he realized he did not simply want to become a professional ventriloquist but to become the best ventriloquist.</li><li>As his dreams to become the best ventriloquist in the world grew stronger over time, he exerted more effort in harnessing his skills in ventriloquism. When he was younger and still hardly training to execute ventriloquy, he would often find himself practicing for several hours in front of the mirror while studying the routines of Edgar Bergen and the how-to record called Jimmy Nelson’s Instant Ventriloquism.</li><li>He made his television debut in 1976.</li><li>After completing his high school education, he was determined to be on the limelight and gave himself the goal of making it to The Tonight Show Starring <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Johnny Carson</a>&nbsp;in 10 years.</li><li>In 1998, he was voted as the Funniest Male Standup at the American Comedy Awards.</li><li>He made his first solo appearance in Comedy Central on July 18, 2003.</li><li>On November 4, 2008, he released his first-ever music album titled Don’t Come Home for Christmas which contains original songs and a parody of Jingle Bells and Jingle Bombs.</li><li>In January 2008, fans voted him as the Top Comic in Comedy Central’s “Stand-Up Showdown”.</li><li>Dunham turns out to be the only person to have won the “Ventriloquist of the Year” award twice, securing a nomination for the “Comedian of the Year” award by the TNN Music City Country Awards, and to have received all praises from the Dallas Morning News for his technique and timing.</li><p>Featured Image by Richard Mclaren / <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Wikimedia</a> / CC BY-SA 3.0</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqOcn55dmcKvtMCmZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-bontatibus-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jay Bontatibus Net Worth</span></a>
