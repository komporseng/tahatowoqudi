<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>What Is Viral Chapstick Challenge On TikTok?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The “chapstick challenge” is a deadly craze that has recently circulated on TikTok, joining the ranks of other harmful trends that have previously gone popular on social media sites. Critics of the challenge believe that it encourages suicidal thinking and puts vulnerable youth in danger of suicide.</p><p>While there are other variants of this challenge circulating on TikTok, the most frequently include a person opening a brand new bottle of chapstick and applying it for the first time, then claiming that they would commit suicide on the day that tube of chapstick runs out.</p><p>Many think that TikTok has once again provided its members with a platform to risk their lives with this challenge. Several videos appearing on social media with the hashtag #chapstickchallenge show teens professing their desire to commit suicide.</p><h2>Why is the TikTok “chapstick challenge” deemed dangerous?</h2><p>The criteria of this challenge are a little hazy since there are other online challenges that need the usage of chapstick or a comparable lip care product. The problem we are cautioned about is when individuals submit videos of themselves with fresh new chapstick on their lips. When they conclude their regimen, they admit that they will commit themselves on the day when the chapstick they have just begun using runs out. In a nutshell, it’s a countdown video to their demise.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Chapstick-Challenge-2.jpg alt="Chapstick Challenge" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>TikTok in similar iterations of this challenge uses chapstick to conceal self-harm scars. None of these versions are safe, and no one should try them under any circumstances.&nbsp;“This is all the chapstick I have left,” one user, Ashley Soris, who tried this challenge, remarked. Fellow users swarmed her video with comments urging her not to continue with the challenge and injure herself.</p><h2>Reaction to the “chapstick challenge”</h2><p>Concerned users are asking challenge participants to halt, ponder, and take mental health seriously. According to one user,</p><p>“I realize you’re going through a rough patch right now, but this isn’t a pattern.” You’re inspiring other students to do the same.”</p><p>The explosion of such challenges reflects the romanticization of death and demonstrates the frightening lengths to which some individuals would go for approval or attention.&nbsp;While some users were harsh in their opposition to the challenge, others attempted to be helpful and kind. One remark stated:</p><p>“You are cherished. Do not attempt this.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>So there’s this labello challenge where everytime you use your chapstick and it ends you kill yourself. How th did it become a challenge ? Don’t follow these people y’all they already going through so much in life they want attention or even take people with them.</p><p>— Anouar 🔥🔥🔥 (@anouarfrk) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2022</a></p><h2>Actions conducted in response to the chapstick challenge</h2><p>TikTok has denied that any challenge exists. According to a statement sent to EuroNews:</p><p>“At TikTok, the safety and well-being of our community are our top priorities, and we have seen no indication of such a trend.” As part of our commitment to keeping our community safe, our review will continue, and should we uncover information that violates our standards, it will be deleted.”</p><p>In France, where the movement seems to be gaining traction, the government has taken the situation extremely seriously and issued a Twitter warning.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Chapstick-Challenge-3.jpg alt="Chapstick Challenge" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Other damaging TikTok trends that have already gone viral</h2><p>TikTok is notorious for instigating trends that encourage self-harm and mental anguish. Other incredibly popular trends included:</p><p>1) “Blackout challenge,” in which competitors had to hold their breath until they blacked out.</p><p>2) “The Penny Challenge,” in which TikTok users plugged a charger halfway into an outlet and then held a penny on the exposed prongs. The individual might get an electric shock, cause a fire, or suffer permanent injury.</p><p>3) “The Milkcrate challenge” requires contestants to climb a structure constructed of milk crates organized like steps.</p><p>Regardless of how hard the backend staff works to remove these dangerous films from their app, certain tasks, such as the “chapstick challenge,” may get through the cracks.&nbsp;Users are advised to report anybody advocating or participating in the “Chapstick Challenge” or any other similar video that encourages suicide or self-harm immediately.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Chapstick Challenge</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>TikTok Trend</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edWiqZqkXZi1orzSraCco12YtaK4y56loJ1dpLtuwMikq6ijXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-harvey-reveals-how-he-feels-about-stepdaughter-lori-dating-michael-b-jordan-472105.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Harvey Reveals How He Feels About Stepdaughter Lori Dating Michael B.
