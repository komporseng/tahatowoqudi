The 'Bangarang' DJ has been forced to cancel the five-date tour due to issues with securing a train as well as booking some of the acts he wanted for the shows. He posted a message to his Facebook <a href=#>reading</a>:</p><p>It is with huge disappointment that we have to announce the Full Flex Express will not be happening in 2013. During the past 4 months we lost the train we had booked, found a new one, and then realized the cost associated with using it would put us at a huge, huge loss. We explored every option to make the Full Flex Express happen but ultimately we could not get around these setbacks. Also, some of the acts we had in mind were unavailable and we only wanted to deliver the best of the best, which is what we think this festival should deliver. The train is near and dear to my heart, and we have every intention of bringing it back in a massive way in 2014 (and for many years after), so please understand that we do this for you and this is just an unfortunate convergence of circumstances. Refunds will be issued at point of purchase and also to everyone who bought a ticket online.</p><p>This would have been the second annual Full Flex Express tour, had the plans gone forward. Last year's tour through Canada <a href=#>featured acts</a> like <a href=#>Diplo</a>, Pretty Lights and Grimes.</p><p>Unfortunately for Skrillex, he doesn't have much else going on this summer, so it looks like he'll be open for booking or perhaps he'll start work on a new album. The only other <a href=#>tour dates</a> he currently has posted on his Facebook are for Coachella in April.</p><p>If you need a wedding DJ, it looks like Skrillex's schedule is wide open now!</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: Check Out EDM Artists Who Have Reinvented Themselves</a><p><strong>Watch the Skrillex 'Bangarang' Video</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kwKy%2ByKWjnrBdmK6vr8SlZJ%2BtnKF6p7jEsWSesKCnsrS%2FjK2mrqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ronnie-van-zant.html><span>←</span><span>Ronnie Van Zant And The Brutal Plane Crash That Took His Life</span></a>
