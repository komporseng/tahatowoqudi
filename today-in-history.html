The war stemmed from the issue of French succession. Two royal houses, the English House of Plantagenet and the French House of Valois, claimed to be the rightful heirs to the throne. This conflict sparked widespread violence across France. Joan of Arc, a young peasant woman, claimed to have visions from God directing her to defend France from English rule. Charles VII, the future King of France, believed in her divinity, and sent Joan of Arc to battles across the country.

This siege was unsuccessful, and Joan of Arc was later captured a year later.</p><h2>1664: New Amsterdam Becomes New York</h2><p>New Amsterdam becomes New York after Dutch Governor Peter Stuyvesant surrenders to the British.
