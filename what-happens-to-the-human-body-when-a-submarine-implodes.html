Our fear is that it imploded at around 3,200 meters,” Titanic expedition leader G. Michael Harris stated.</p><p>Harris emphasized that due to the Titanic wreckage’s location at a staggering depth of 13,000 feet below sea level, it is currently impossible to predict the exact fate of the Titan submersible.</p><p>He further highlighted that undertaking such an expedition carries specific guidelines and precautions that must be adhered to by all involved.</p><p>Understanding and following the established rules and protocols associated with deep-sea exploration is of utmost importance.</p><p>By doing so, the safety of the personnel involved and the integrity of the investigation can be ensured.</p><p>As the search for the Titan submersible continues, it is crucial for all parties to prioritize compliance with these guidelines in order to achieve the best possible outcomes.</p><p><a href=#>Real Admiral John Mauger</a>, in an interview with The Mirror, expressed his belief that the Titan submersible could potentially be trapped within the wreckage of the Titanic.</p><p>He further explained that the lack of suitable equipment capable of searching the bottommost depths adds to the challenge of locating the vehicle.</p><p>The presence of extensive debris within the wreckage site exacerbates the difficulty of the search operation.</p><p>These factors collectively contribute to the complex nature of the mission and underscore the challenges faced by the search teams in their efforts to find the Titan submersible.</p><p>While the fate of the Titan submersible remains uncertain, the Coast Guard retains hope that the vehicle might be floating on the surface of the water, which would simplify the search and rescue operation.</p><p>However, as the whereabouts of the submersible remain unknown, concerns among the public continue to rise.</p><p>The limited supply of 96 hours’ worth of oxygen inside the vehicle adds to the urgency and gravity of the situation.</p><p>Efforts to locate and recover the submersible are crucial in order to ensure the safety and well-being of the individuals on board.</p><h3><span id=OceanGate_Expeditions_charged_250000_for_each_passenger>OceanGate Expeditions charged $250,000 for each passenger</span></h3><p>On June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible, carrying a total of five passengers, went missing.</p><p>Among those on board were Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate, renowned billionaire British explorer Hamish Harding, French Titanic expert Henri Nargeleot, and British businessman Shahzana Dawood and his son Suleman.</p><p>The disappearance of the submersible and the individuals on board has sparked widespread concern and initiated an extensive search and rescue operation to locate them and determine their well-being.</p><p>The journey of the Titan submersible commenced on Friday from St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada.</p><p>Hamish Harding, in a Facebook post, shared that it marked the first manned mission to the Titanic in 2023.</p><p>He expressed their readiness to embark on the expedition the following day, as weather conditions appeared to be improving.</p><p>Subsequently, at 12 pm on Sunday, the submersible began its dive.</p><p>However, after approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes, it went missing.</p><p>As it failed to resurface by 7 pm, a missing report was filed with the US Coast Guard, initiating a coordinated search and rescue operation involving multiple authorities.</p><p>In addition to the ongoing rescue efforts, a French robot named Victor 6000 has joined the mission, bolstering the capabilities of the search teams as they strive to locate the missing submersible and its occupants.</p><p>The collaboration between different entities underscores the urgency and magnitude of the operation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifLi0wK1koZmgpbKvv4ytpmasmJp6qcHMmqVmmp%2BZxm7Dx56lZpldqMKjucCroKedXZ66sbjOnZysZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ariel-winter-space-cowgirl-halloween-costume-2019-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Photos Of Sexy Look Hollywood Life</span></a>
