But once I got the drone out there, it was unreal how much it looked like – well, you know.”</p><p>The iceberg looked so similar to the male reproductive organ that many people thought the images might’ve been faked.</p><p>“People don’t believe it’s real. They think it’s photoshopped and all that,” Pretty told The Guardian. “I can tell you – it’s real.”</p><p>Only a day after photographing the iceberg, however, Pretty found out that its top had collapsed. Despite this loss, Pretty kept his good humor.</p><p>“The day after I took the picture, the ‘shape’ of interest collapsed, so I probably have the last ‘erect’ picture of it,” Pretty told Insider.</p><p>One user even posted a memorial <a href=# rel=noopener>video</a> for the iceberg featuring funerary doves and set to Sarah McLachlan, with the caption: “Gone, but not forgotten. Forever in our hearts.”</p><p>Pretty acknowledges that the name of his hometown also played a big role in the story going viral.</p><p>“I’m from Dildo, so imagine if [the iceberg] came into Dildo, how much traction it would get,” Pretty said to Saltwire.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-434761 alt="Dildo Canada Sign" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dildo-canada-sign.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-434761 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Jennifer Bain</span><span class=caption-body>A welcome sign for the town of Dildo, Canada.</span></p><p>While the sight of a penis-shaped iceberg is unusual, the presence of icebergs in Newfoundland, where the town of Dildo is located, is quite common.</p><p>Ocean currents from the north push freezing water into Newfoundland and Labrador in the Spring, resulting in hundreds of icebergs and some of the cleanest water in the world.</p><p>The Newfoundland and Labrador governments even set up an Iceberg Finder website, which allows residents to locate, track, and upload images of icebergs as they move through their waters.</p><p>With frequent icy visitors, the region has had other phallic incidents in the past.</p><p>In 2017, guests on a horticulture tour snapped pictures of another phallic iceberg floating around Newfoundland’s Northern Peninsula.</p><p>Even further back, icebergs have taken the form of other surprising shapes, including that of the Virgin Mary. In 1905, residents noticed this holy iceberg floating in their waterways and snapped a photo of it.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-434792 alt="Our Lady Of The Fjords" width=700 height=438 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/our-lady-of-the-fjords.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-434792 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>A 1905 image of an iceberg resembling the Virgin Mary.</span></p><p>When <a href=# rel=noopener>The Canadian Press</a> asked Pretty if his discovery would join the ranks of other historically significant iceberg sightings, he laughed:</p><p>“We’ll see.”</p><p>After reading about the penis-shaped iceberg, learn about <a href=#>the phallic Roman relic that may be the world’s oldest sex toy</a>.
