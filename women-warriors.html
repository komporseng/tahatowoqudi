What’s more, women warriors can often do it better.</p><p>Before there was Wonder Woman, there were these 11 women warriors.</p><h2>Women Warriors Joan of Arc</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194985 alt="Female Warriors Joan Of Arc" width=750 height=855 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/joan-of-arc-sword.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194985 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Joan of Arc.</span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joan of Arc</a> is one of the world’s most famous women warriors. She was a natural military leader and when she took up swords against the English to lead the French forces to victory, she cemented her place in the history books.</p><p>As a young girl, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joan of Arc</a> had visions and believed that she was chosen by God to lead the French to victory against the British. Joan of Arc had no military training but convinced Prince Charles of Valois to let her command a French army in battle anyway.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194986 alt="Joan Of Arc Kneals" width=600 height=788 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/joan-of-arc-knees.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194986 class=wp-caption-text>Joan of Arc.</p><p>She successfully led French forces to a win in a battle in the city of Orléans and with that victory, she won the respect she needed to keep fighting and commanding.</p><p>In the early 15th century, Joan of Arc led a regiment against the English during a portion of the Hundred Years’ War. For an entire year, she donned men’s clothing and a cropped haircut and warred against Anglo-Burgundian forces.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194987 alt="Joan Of Arc Capture" width=900 height=654 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/joan-of-arc-capture.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194987 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Joan of Arc when she was captured.</span></p><p>Unfortunately, even the fiercest of warriors aren’t immune from capture. Acting under orders given by her king, Joan of Arc confronted an English attack near Compiègne in 1430. She was captured, jailed, and charged with more than 70 crimes. At just 19-years-old she was sentenced to death by burning for her charges.</p><p>20 years after Joan of Arc’s death, her name was finally cleared. She was eventually canonized in 1920 and is regarded as one of the patron saints of France.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4u8yepWavkae%2FqrvRrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./louis-pascarella-of-webster-ny-fatally-crushed-by-salt-truck-in-perinton.html><span>←</span><span>Louis Pascarella of Webster, NY, Fatally Crushed by Salt Truck in Perinton</span></a>
