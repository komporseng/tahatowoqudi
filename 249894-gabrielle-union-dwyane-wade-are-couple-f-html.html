The best bits were when she and Wade worked out together in complete synergy without any equipment.</p><p class=dh>Union also announced a giveaway of her favorite fitness goodies for those who like her post. She also promised that the app will make anybody sweat and get back in shape.</p><p class=dh>The couple's chemistry is undeniable, and fans love it.

As for Union, she keeps herself toned with frequent workouts. She opened up to Women's Health about her fitness routine in 2020.</p><p class=dh>During the interview, Union revealed a surprising secret. Apparently, she does not spend hours at the gym to keep that body strong — all she needs is 18-minute cardio and three 50-minute workouts each week.</p><p class=dh>Going into the specifics, Union said she likes to mix things up and keep it simple. That helps her avoid the anxiety that comes with staring at the treadmill! She further <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30336177/gabrielle-union-cardio-workout/>shared</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Cardio could be jumping jacks, running up my driveway, side shuffles like I used to do in basketball, an elliptical, treadmill, or sled pushes."</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Union</a> swears by lunges and squats, the two exercises that have never failed her. Not one thing that she has done in terms of exercising has stuck, but the two lower body exercises are her favorites.</p><p class=dh>Keeping a resistance band in her backpack helps her amp things up. The cult-favorite pieces of elastic help her keep her workouts simple and effective no matter where she is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrcnBpaXqorcGroJ6knJp6trrIqKVmnKeurq%2BxjLCYnZ1dlr%2BmecKorKmklWKzb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christina-mcnown-bio-age-net-worth-cade-mcnown.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Christina McNown, Cade McNown's Wife!
