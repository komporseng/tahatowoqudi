Despite the efforts of its biggest organizations, the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) and USA Ultimate, ultimate did not make the final list of sports that were asked to make a final proposal to the LA28 organizing committee.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>This decision came as a major blow to the sport's <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympic</a> dreams, especially considering its wide international appeal and competitive presence in 103 countries worldwide.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Analysis and Impact</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The exclusion of ultimate from the 2028 <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a> is a significant development, considering the sport's global reach and appeal.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The decision to remove ultimate from consideration raises questions about the criteria and evaluation process used to determine the inclusion of sports in the <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a>.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>It also brings to light the challenges and complexities involved in the selection of sports for the <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympic</a> program, especially considering the need to balance the inclusion of traditional and emerging sports while ensuring gender equality and youth appeal.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Other Excluded Sports</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to ultimate, several other sports were not included in the 2028 <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a> program.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>These included sports such as motorsport, karate, kickboxing, and breakdancing, among others. Each <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympic</a> Games has the flexibility to add a small number of additional sports to its program.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Still, the exclusion of these sports from the 2028 <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a> suggests a careful and deliberate selection process based on specific evaluation criteria set out before the process began.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>IOC's Selection Criteria</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The selection of sports for the 2028 <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a> was based on a thorough process and analysis, considering evaluation criteria such as gender equality, utilization of existing facilities, involvement of a wide range of sports communities both in the United States and globally.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>This rigorous approach to sport selection reflects the IOC's commitment to ensuring a diverse and engaging <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympic</a> program that resonates with athletes and fans worldwide.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The exclusion of sports from the <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a> program is a complex and carefully considered process, and the decision to remove certain sports from the 2028 <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a> in Los Angeles reflects the challenges and considerations involved in shaping the <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympic</a> program.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Even though&nbsp;some sports, including ultimate, were not included in the 2028 <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a>, the selection of sports such as baseball/softball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse, and squash for the LA28 <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a> underscores the IOC's commitment to showcasing a diverse and iconic array of sports while engaging with new athlete and fan communities in the US and globally.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While the exclusion of certain sports from the <a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/olympics>Olympics</a> may raise questions and concerns, it also highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of the <a href=#>Olympic</a> program, as well as the ongoing efforts to balance tradition with innovation, and to provide a platform for a wide range of sports to shine on the global stage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mimpbGdpbakv46wn5qsXai9sL7TrGSwnaKaerOxzKitnpxdm7%2BwuYytn55ln6HGrrzInKpmoZ5if3F%2Blw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blackpink-maknae-lisa-fashion-outfit-net-worth-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Explore Her Net Worth, &amp;amp; Parents Details</span></a>
