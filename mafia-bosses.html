The man appeared to be mentally unstable. But he was not what he seemed. His name was <a href=# rel=noopener>Vincent “The Chin” Gigante</a> and he was actually a mob boss who faked insanity to avoid jail time.</p><p>Born on March 28, 1928, in New York City, Gigante became a protégé of Mafia boss Vito Genovese at a young age, allegedly because Genovese helped out his family by paying for his mother’s surgery. Nicknamed “The Chin” — from the diminutive of Vincent Vincenzo —&nbsp;Gigante swiftly accumulated a lengthy rap sheet.</p><p>Gigante was willing to go to great lengths for Genovese, as he proved in 1957. Then, as Genovese tried to seize control of the Luciano Family from Frank Costello, Gigante allegedly attempted to assassinate Costello. <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a> reports that a doorman identified Gigante but Costello, who afterward ceded control to Genovese, said that he hadn’t recognized the gunman.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-460384 alt="Vincent Gigante In Jail" width=600 height=808 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/vincent-gigante-in-jail.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-460384 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Apic/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Vincent Gigante after his failed assassination attempt on Frank Costello.

By then, Gigante had begun his infamous “insanity” charade. Because he knew he was under police surveillance, the mob boss would wander around his New York neighborhood in a bathrobe and feign mental illness.</p><p>All the while, he was secretly busy at work building the Genovese Family into one of the country’s most powerful criminal organizations.</p><p>But the authorities eventually caught onto Vincent Gigante. In 1996, a judge ruled that Gigante was mentally competent to stand trial on murder and racketeering charges. He was found guilty in 1997 and sentenced to 12 years in prison, where Gigante died in 2005.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyurcWimGaan6jApr%2BOamc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./he-was-very-standoffish-holly-guess-mom-claims-daughter-was-fooled-by-jesse-mc-faddens-charms.html><span>←</span><span>'He kept them under lock and key': Holly Guess' mom claims daughter was 'fooled' by Jesse McFadden's</span></a>
