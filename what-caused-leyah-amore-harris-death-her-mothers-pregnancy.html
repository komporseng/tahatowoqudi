Her Mothers Pregnancy</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Tameka Cottle, a singer-songwriter, and rapper T.I. had a baby girl named Leyah Amore Harris who died shortly after birth. Despite the fact that Leyah died more than a decade ago, there is still some speculation about the cause of her death.</strong></p><h2>What Happened to Leyah Amore Harris, Who Was Stillborn?</h2><p>T.I. and Cottle became parents for the first time in August 2004, with the birth of their son Clifford “King” Harris III. Three years later, the couple announced that they were expecting their second child, a girl. Unfortunately, the pregnancy ended in tragedy. In an exclusive interview with Essence Magazine, the singer discussed her pregnancy struggles.</p><p>She stated that the sac that held her baby girl was split in two and that they had not been combined since the girl growing inside her was 16 weeks old. The baby was “positioned in the middle of those two sacs,” according to the Grammy Award-winning musician. The fetus “could become entangled in her umbilical cord,” according to doctors.</p><p>Despite the doctor’s numerous warnings, Cottle never considered terminating the pregnancy. Cottle went to see a specialist six months after giving birth, which had a disastrous outcome.</p><h2>Leyah Amore Harris’s funeral</h2><p>Leyah’s family had a lovely funeral service planned for their late baby girl. Their relatives and a few others were present. Cottle also admitted that she only visits the cemetery on “holidays and special days” because it is “too sad.” T.I. and Cottle, Leyah Amore Harris’ parents and siblings, began dating in 2001. They dated for approximately nine years before marrying on July 30, 2010. Their nuptials were held in Miami Beach, Florida.</p><p>Despite being boyfriend and girlfriend for over a decade, they couldn’t do what a married couple could. Tiny filed for divorce from T.I. in late 2016, after approximately six years of marriage. According to a source, the couple is currently working on a reconciliation. They have seven kids. They welcomed their first child, a son named King, in 2004. When their son Major was born in May 2008, they became parents for the second time.</p><p>In addition, Heiress Harris, their daughter, was born in March 2016. On Christmas Day of 2015, T.I. and Tiny announced their pregnancy. T.I. also has three children from previous relationships, including two sons with his ex-girlfriend Lashon Thompson, Messiah and Domani, and a daughter, Deyjah, with rapper Ms. Niko. He was previously involved with Bernice Burgos.</p><p>Cottle also has a daughter with her ex-boyfriend, Zonnie “Zeboe” Pullins, named Zonnique.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>celebrity child</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Leah Weber | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>A broadcast journalist and well-known youngster are Leah Weber.
