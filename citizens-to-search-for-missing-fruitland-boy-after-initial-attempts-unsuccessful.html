The Fruitland Police Department would like to extend a sincere thanks to all of our partner first responders and our community for taking the time to help us thoroughly search the area. As we continue the investigation. We are asking for the community's help with locating Michael Joseph Vaughan by remaining vigilant and observant."<br></p><h2><br></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmpaeTlrlwr8itoLOdnqh6tbuMrJyaqpOdeqe70WakoqujnruoecWrrKKsnJa7pXnBqLBmmZapsrN5yKegraGRoXqiwNOepKmso2LCr7%2FUnJqeq6Obwq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sara-weinshenk-wiki-age-height-net-worth-boyfriend-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>Sara Weinshenk Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
