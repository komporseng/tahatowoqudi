The former couple were spotted&nbsp;at La Esquina restaurant in neighborhood of Soho, as seen in new photos from their rainy night out [<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>HERE</strong></a>]. Selena, 27, was seen arriving to the eatery with friends, with Samuel, 26, arriving soon with a group of pals, DailyMail reports.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lose You To Love Me</a>” singer, who’s been on a press tour for her newly released love songs, looked chic. She wore a black and white pinstriped pajama style button-up long sleeve and matching pants. The PUMA brand ambassador wore a pair of clean white sneakers by the brand. Sel rocked silver hoop earrings and wore her wavy brunette hair with caramel highlights back in a ponytail.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meanwhile Krost, who launched a fashion brand of same name, wore black trousers and a black, yellow and green long sleeve shirt with a white collar. He stepped out taupe colored boots with red laces. Samuel was also pictured wearing a black sling on his left arm. It’s unclear how he was injured.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Selena and Samuel were first linked in late 2015. The two were spotted out on a dinner date in New York in November of that year, where Selena was pictured sitting on Samuel’s lap. The pair were later seen on vacation together in January 2016 with a small group of friends. Later that month, Selena and Samuel were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pictured holding hands</a> after night out at 1Oak nightclub in Los Angeles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In August of that same year, it was reported that Samuel seemingly addressed his relationship with the singer in a post on Instagram that he later deleted. “Selena is a real girl with a real heart and real feelings. All you superficial who are just unhappy with your love lives, understand that love is real. Although we have ventured on separate paths, at least I know that love exists. I love you, Sel,” Samuel allegedly wrote, according to <a class=class href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elle</a>.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Before their most recent reunion, Selena and Samuel united in February at her best friend <strong>Courtney Barry</strong>‘s wedding. They were pictured standing next to each other in a group photo from the event.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>After Samuel, Selena went on to date <strong>The Weeknd</strong>, and she briefly reunited with her on-again, off-again ex, <strong>Justin Bieber</strong>, who married<strong> Hailey Baldwin</strong> in September 2018.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>As far as we know, Selena is currently single. While she’s certainly open to finding love, as she sings in her new “Look At Her Now” track, a source close to the singer told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that her love life isn’t her main focus at the moment.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Selena is open to finding love again but it’s not a huge focus for her, she’s not on the hunt. But she does have a wish list, she knows what she’s looking for,” the insider said, explaining, “She wants a real and mature love, a partner that she can connect with on every level, someone that’s not afraid to get really deep with her because when she loves, she goes all in. She wants a guy that’s very secure in himself and confident but NOT cocky, that’s a big turn off for her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5xe5JpZqydnJq7onnGqKSesl2nsra6yK2crGWjlrq2sctmoquno6l6psSMm6aynqKesq%2BwjKmfqKyfqHqvxcJmm5qslWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kwan-usamanee.html><span>←</span><span>Kwan Usamanee</span></a>
