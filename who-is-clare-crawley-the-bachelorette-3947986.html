After appearing on several Bachelor shows, Clare married&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ryan Hawkins</a>&nbsp;</strong>in February 2023 and they announced that they’re<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> expecting their first child together via surrogate</a> on July 12. “Baby Dawkins will be arriving via our amazing angel surrogate, in January 2024!!” Clare wrote alongside an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram clip</a> where she announced her baby news.</p><p>Clare is famous for her appearances on The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, Bachelor in Paradise, and Bachelor Winter Games. But it’s been a few years since Clare has appeared on television. Here’s a refresher on Clare!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Clare-Crawley-Pregnant-5-Things-embed-1.jpg><h2>She’s having a baby with her husband Ryan Hawkins.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Clare announced that she’s expecting her first child with her husband on July 12, five months after the couple got married. Clare shared the news by posting a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>special video</a> playing a cover of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hilary Duff</strong></a>‘s “What Dreams Are Made Of.” In the clip, Clare and Ryan hung their clothes to dry outside and added a white onesie to reveal that they’re having a baby. “Our laundry is about to get a whole lot cuter in 2024!!”, Clare gushed in the caption. The onesie read “Worth The Wait” in cursive lettering and was hung alongside two pink t-shirts.</p><h2>She first appeared on season 18 of ‘The Bachelor’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Clare was a contestant on&nbsp;<strong>Juan Pablo Galavis’</strong> season of&nbsp;The Bachelor. Like many of Juan Pablo’s relationships on the show, his romance with Clare had a lot of ups and downs. Clare made it to the final rose ceremony, but Juan Pablo eliminated her and chose&nbsp;<strong>Nikki Ferrell</strong> instead. However, Clare left the show in an epic fashion, telling JP off one last time before making her exit!</p><h2>She’s been on two seasons of ‘Bachelor in Paradise’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>After her split from Juan Pablo, Clare went to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bachelor in Paradise</a> for the show’s first season in 2014. However, things did not go great, and she found herself involved in some drama with&nbsp;<strong>AshLee Frazier</strong>, which led her to quit during week five. She returned for the show’s second season in 2015, where she made waves for telling the contestants that the season 1 cast was ‘more genuine.’ She was eliminated during week three when no one gave her a rose.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Clare went on to appear in&nbsp;Bachelor Winter Games in the winter of 2018. During the show, she found herself in a love triangle with <strong>Benoit Beausejour-Savard</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Christian Rauch</strong>. She broke Benoit’s heart by choosing Christian, but her relationship with Christian did not make it until the end of the show. After filming, Clare re-connected with Benoit, and he proposed to her at the reunion special, which aired in Feb. 2018. Unfortunately, the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pair’s relationship ended</a> by April 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Clare-Crawley-Pregnant-5-Things-embed-2.jpg><h2>She’s still the oldest star of ‘The Bachelorette’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Clare was 38 years old when she started filming <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her Bachelorette season</a> which aired in late 2020. She is still the oldest star The Bachelorette has ever had. After four episodes, Clare got engaged to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dale Moss</a>&nbsp;</strong>and they left the show together.&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tayshia Adams</a>&nbsp;</strong>replaced Clare as the lead star for the remainder of the season. Clare and Dale had an on-and-off relationship that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ended for good</a> in September 2021.</p><h2>She’s a hairstylist</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Clare was working as a hairstylist during her first appearance on&nbsp;The Bachelor, and is still in that field today. She works at De Facto Salon in Sacramento, California, according to her Instagram page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kwra3RnmScqpGsuabFjK2fnmWSlrCpscuoqZ6spJp6dIWTcHBxbl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./landon-zehr.html><span>←</span><span>Landon Zehr- Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Dating</span></a>
