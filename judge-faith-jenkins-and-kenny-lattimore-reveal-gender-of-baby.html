The filling, which was pink, indicated the couple’s expectancy of a girl.</p><p>“We are so excited to share – and so many of you guessed correctly,” Faith and Kenny said. “Kenny, you are going to be the best dad to our little scholar,” Judge Faith wrote to her husband. “I can only hope our baby has your kind heart and genuine soul as I know the world will be that much of a better place,” the mommy-to-be added.</p><p>Kenny Lattimore and Judge Faith Jenkins <a href=#>announced their expectancy</a> of a child earlier this year. The couple took to Instagram with the news of their family’s expansion.</p><p>“Season two of my crime show isn’t the only thing I’ve been producing this summer,” Judge Faith told her social media fans in August. “My husband, @kennylattimore, and I are SO excited to share that we are expecting our greatest blessing yet,” she continued. “We cannot begin to express how thrilled we are for this next chapter in our lives!”</p><p>Fans learned of Kenny Lattimore and Judge Faith’s marriage several months after the couple <a href=#>tied the knot</a>. The Lattimores decided to wed during the height of the COVID pandemic, which automatically meant a smaller ceremony. Judge Faith recently shared how she refused to let stereotypes force her to settle down with a life partner who was not right for her.</p><p>“I embraced the fact that I was living my journey and no one else’s,” Judge Jenkins shared. “There are almost eight billion people on this planet. We can’t all be doing the same thing at the same time,” she added. “I wasn’t going to let anyone make me feel like because I wasn’t married by a certain age that there was something wrong with me or that I was off on some timeline of life.”</p><p>Judge Faith and Kenny Lattimore are expecting their baby girl to arrive in the coming weeks.</p><p>Photo: Kenny Lattimore/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWtmamhfZoRwttSdnp5llpa2tbSMo5yno5mjwG6tzZ1kpJ2eo8ZuuMCtq6Kln6eybr7Er5yapF2csq%2BwxKtkqJ5dl66jxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gugu-mbatha-raw-too-busy-juggling-philanthropy-and-acting-career-to-have-a-dating-life-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gugu Mbatha-Raw Too Busy Juggling Philanthropy and Acting Career to Have a Dating Life</span></a>
