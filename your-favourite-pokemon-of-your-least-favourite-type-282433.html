I know that Normal is supposed to be the "plain and boring" type, but imo that description unintentionally fit the Fighting-type a lot more: from day 1 Normal had its share of very unusual designs and creatures such as computer programs, cute little cryptids, vaguely axolotl-like nurses, kangaroosaurus moms, and whatever the heck the Lickitung line's supposed to be. Fighting on the other hand for a very long time had virtually all of its designs being just some flavor of humanoid martial artist, meaning a lot of them were very samey. The first Fighting-type I truly liked and that remains on the tippy top of my favorites to this day was <b>Breloom</b> both because I found it cute and because it was just so strange for its type (though granted, being part Grass probably helped). Next was the <b>Lucario line</b>, which yeah, makes me sound like a huge hypocrite because it is essentially just a "humanoid martial artist" too, but what helped that one is that it's a dog and I am a huge sucker for dogs. But then Gen 5 is when Fighting designs were kicked into high gear: we got punk lizards that cleverly use their shed skin as makeshift clothes in the <b>Scraggy line</b>, elegant (a design descriptor not seen often in the Fighting-type, since most try extremely hard to be as macho as possible) Xiaolin mustelids in the <b>Mienfoo line</b>, and even a group of quadrupeds (a first for this type and something I honestly never thought would ever be done) in the Musketeers. Gen 8 also brought us other very fun concepts for Fighting-types like a shield wolf and a troop of adorable roman warriors.<p>TL; DR, Fighting started out incredibly restricted in its designs, but once it expanded its horizons into what the concept of the word "Fighting" means, it truly came into its own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy6u9SrZJ%2BZpqTCs7XTnmSpp5uaurC6jKidZrGfqr9uuMSaqq1llpbDsMHRoqueZaSuvaZ6kXFpbWtjZL2is8Rmag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-chad-veach-5072385.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Chad Veach?
