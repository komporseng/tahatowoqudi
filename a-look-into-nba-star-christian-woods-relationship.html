<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>A Look Into NBA Star Christian Woods Relationship</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Christian Wood needs no introduction in the NBA. He is presently a member of the Houston Rockets and aspires to be an All-Star. Much has been said and written about his NBA career, but little is known about his personal life, including whether or not he has a girlfriend.</p><p>According to rumors, the NBA superstar began playing basketball for Findlay Prep in high school. In Findlay, he helped the Pilots win 54 straight games and the ESPN National High School Invitational in 2012. In 2013, Rivals ranked him as the No. 36 overall player, while Scout ranked him as the No. 10 at his position and ESPN ranked him as the No. 71 prospect overall.</p><p>Wood then went on to UNLV, where he played for the UNLV Runnin’ Rebels men’s basketball team from 2013 to 2015. Wood was named first-team All-Mountain West and declared for the NBA draft in 2015.&nbsp;Everyone who has followed his profession is aware of this fact, but what about his dating life?</p><h2>Who is Christian Wood Dating?</h2><p>It is unknown who the sportsman is presently seeing, however, he was previously involved with reality personality Maya Benberry. Wood’s ex-girlfriend came to prominence after appearing in Catching Kelce, a Bachelor-style reality program in which she earned the opportunity to date NFL player Travis Kelce.&nbsp;Unfortunately, their romance did not work out, and the reality star eventually admitted to being cheated on. She then went to season 2 of MTV’s reality program Ex on the Beach, where she attempted to make a new start with her former partner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Christian-Wood-2.jpg alt="Christian Wood" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>That again did not work out, and Wood and Benberry were soon thought to be dating. When the couple’s relationship became public, it became a controversy. Benberry reportedly took Wood from her closest friend, according to sources.&nbsp;The reality actress, however, did not take the allegations lightly and defended herself on Instagram, which Side Action republished. She said that everything mentioned about her was false and begged Janelle Shanks, a Bad Girls Club graduate and her buddy from Ex on the Beach, to cease spreading these falsehoods.</p><h2>Christian Wood Girlfriend Dumped Him</h2><p>While Benberry was telling her truth, Wood remained silent and did not address the issue. And it seems that the romance faded out too soon. Wood seems to have had a girlfriend prior to his relationship with Benberry.&nbsp;In the offseason of 2020, the sportsman signed a three-year, $41 million deal with the Houston Rockets. Following that, he spoke with The Ringer about his career and the terrible night of 2015.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Christian-Wood-1.jpg alt="Christian Wood" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The athlete was predicted to be selected as a late first-round selection in the NBA draft in 2015. His greatest worries were realized when he remained uncalled in the second round. He’d been passed over for the draft, but the night became much worse when his girlfriend abandoned him. Wood said that after the draft, he sent her off at the airport and never saw her again.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmamkpZ6tMDAq2ScoKKewLW1wKdksKefmcBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-kid-larois-mother-sloane-howard-is-linked-to-10000-credit-card-crime-spree.html><span>←</span><span>The Kid Laroi's mother Sloane Howard is linked to $10,000 credit card crime spree</span></a>
