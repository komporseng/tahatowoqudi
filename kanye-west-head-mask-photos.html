For the outdoor meeting with a few people ostensibly on his team, the “Off the Grid” rapper wore a full black mask covering over his entire head, keeping a low profile from the public. He paired the accessory with a large leather jacket and black jeans tucked into rainboots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kanye-west-face-mask-splash-post11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The avant-garde style, however strange to some, is pretty typical of Ye, whose close relationship with Balenciaga creative director <strong>Demna Gvasalia&nbsp;</strong>has resulted in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>similar choices</a> over the past year and also undoubtedly influenced his estranged wife,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>. The reality star notably sported [literal] head-to-toe Balenciaga for the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2021 Met Gala with Demna in tow</a> — himself also sporting a face covering that initially led some to believe it was Kanye joining Kim for the event. Some also interpreted Kim’s BDSM-inspired Balenciaga looks to be <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>even more symbolic than realized</a> — as it relates to her ex — but the jury’s still out on that one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kanye-west-face-mask-backgrid-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>As far as Kanye’s symbolic meaning … could he be hiding after the whole <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>debacle</a> involving his daughter <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chicago</a></strong>‘s fourth birthday party on Jan. 15? When the rapper claimed he&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hadn’t been told the address</a> for the event which was thrown with with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kylie Jenner</a>&nbsp;</strong>as a joint party for&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stormi Webster</strong></a>, a&nbsp;source close to the Kardashian family told <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>EXCLUSIVELY that Kim and Kanye’s co-parenting relationship doesn’t need to involve going to every single party together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4 data-skm-boomerang-el-0=processed>The source revealed that his estranged wife didn’t ask him to come in the first place, since he’s not part of the family anymore. “Kim really didn’t invite Kanye to the party. He’s no longer a part of the family, they don’t have to all be together for the birthday parties, at least right now. They’re not together. Kanye chose to move across the street to co-parent,” they said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5ByZqSZnq6ybsPErKtmoJWWsW65wKyiZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-you-sell-autographs-without-certificate-of-authenticity.html><span>←</span><span>Can you sell autographs without a certificate of authenticity?</span></a>
