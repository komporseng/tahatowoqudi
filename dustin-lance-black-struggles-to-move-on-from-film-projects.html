It’s hard.</p><p>“I don’t think I ever just move on. I think it’s gonna take time to put myself back together, but good. Isn’t that what we’re supposed to do? If it was easy, I’d probably make a lot more money and it wouldn’t take as long. This has not been an easy one. This has been challenging. I think it’s gonna take a little time to heal and I might not make something that comes out next year, but that’s okay. I don’t do that anyway. I take my time.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Dustin – who is married to superstar diver <a href=# class=exposure-link data-linktrack=LinkTracker,articleExposure,tom-daley>Tom Daley</a>, 28, and has four-year-old Robert-Ray with him – revealed that he is working on a movie musical, but insisted it will not be a romantic comedy.</p><p>He told Collider: ” I am currently writing a musical that I’ve had to put aside for a little bit. But it’s not a musical rom-com. Music might be healing. We’ll see. I have to feel like we’re breaking something open that needs to be broken, or else I’d rather just stay in bed. That’s just how I’m built. I think I get it from my mom. My mom was curious, and my mom didn’t take s***from anybody. “</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnaysrJmjeq2tzZycZpqclrCsedKtqa6fl6GytHnTqGSmp6aaerC6jJ%2BpqKVdm7atuYypqaiilZjBtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./assaad-bouab.html><span>←</span><span>Assaad Bouab- Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Wife, Marriage, Height</span></a>
