In addition to being his personal companion, Conrad’s girlfriend is also his professional partner. She is a full-time Twitch broadcaster and has appeared in his YouTube and Twitch shows.</strong></p><h2><span id=In_an_airport_Aydan_Conrad_met_his_lover_for_the_first_time>In an airport, Aydan Conrad met his lover for the first time</span></h2><p>Conrad is currently seeing Danielle Sweets, whom he claims to have met at an airport. In a 2019 YouTube video introducing his fiancee, the YouTuber stated that he met Sweets while traveling for a competition.</p><p>At a Starbucks in the Chicago airport, the two were seated. As the streamer called Sweets at the airport to organize a meeting in advance, it appeared that the two had met previously. Sweets insisted that the meeting was a date, but her partner argued that it was only because she made an effort to see him.</p><h2><span id=Aydan_and_Dani_have_two_pets_in_their_home>Aydan and Dani have two pets in their home</span></h2><p>Conrad and Sweets’ relationship has advanced greatly from their first encounter at the airport; they now reside together. Multiple tweets from the streamer and his fiancée reveal that they have two dogs named Bambi and Thumper.</p><p>Since the streamer stated in a 2019 YouTube Q&A video that he was “not ready” for two dogs, Thumper appears to be a recent addition.</p><p>They also said that when Bambi was a puppy, he was the root of countless disagreements between them. In addition, none of them could now afford to raise two dogs, both financially and in terms of time.</p><p>Taking care of a young dog required, predictably, a large amount of time and dedication from an already busy schedule.</p><p>According to elementary math, acquiring a second dog would result in a doubling of these efforts. Nevertheless, the couple overcame all of that and decided to acquire another furry child.</p><h2><span id=Additionally_Danielle_Sweets_a_Twitch_Streamer>Additionally, Danielle Sweets, a Twitch Streamer</span></h2><p>Sweets is a Twitch streamer who enjoys playing a variety of games, such as Rust, Minecraft, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and, of course, Fortnite.</p><p>According to her Twitch profile, she has been playing video games since receiving a Nintendo DS at age five. In addition, her Twitter account features the flags of Cambodia and Vietnam, hinting that she is a native of one or both of these countries.</p><p>Since both Sweets and Conrad are Twitch broadcasters, their paths have crossed several times throughout the course of their respective streaming careers.</p><p>Indeed, Conrad stated that their full-time streaming employment made it impossible to care for their dog, resulting in numerous disagreements.</p><p>Despite this, Sweets is always supportive of her boyfriend’s professional endeavors, and Conrad has appeared in challenges and Fortnite broadcasts on Sweets’ YouTube channel.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>YouTuber</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Emily Seebohm Partner: Is She Dating David ‘Luttsy’ Lutteral?
